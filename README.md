### Hi there

Not all code hosted here is beautiful or even good; there are old code and experimentations, so please don’t judge too harshly.


### About me

I’ve been working with development for over 20 years.
My first contact with programming was at 8 years old, with a [CP‑400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prol%C3%B3gica_CP-400), a TRS‑80 clone. (I don’t miss it).

My journey has been driven by a fascination with technology. I enjoy learning and experimenting with interesting tools and technologies.


### IT things I like

**Technologies I’ve worked with and liked:**
Python, ASP.NET Core, Android Native, ORMs, Cross‑platform apps (Win, Mac, Linux), Vue, Angular, Alpine JS, Django, SQLite, Chromium Embedded Framework, Data Mining, Cassandra, and PostgreSQL…
I’ve worked with Java and JEE for years, but… they didn’t make this list. \:grimacing:


### What I'm doing

* Working on exciting new features in **Plagius** – plagiarism‑detection software.

  * A stable **Plagius for Mac** is finally out \o/🎉
* Learning more about distributed database systems, Vue, CEF, cross‑platform development with Avalonia…
