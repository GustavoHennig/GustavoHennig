### Hi there

Not all code hosted here is beautiful or even good; there are old code and experimentations, so please donâ€™t judge too harshly.

### About me

Iâ€™ve been working with development for over 18 years.  
My first contact with programming was at 8 years old, with a [CP-400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prol%C3%B3gica_CP-400), a TRS-80 clone. (I donâ€™t miss it).

My journey has been driven by a fascination with technology. I enjoy learning and experimenting with interesting tools and technologies.

### IT things I like

**Technologies Iâ€™ve worked with and liked:**  

Python, ASP.NET CORE, Android Native, ORMs, Cross-platform apps (Win, Mac, Linux), Vue, Angular, Alpine JS, Django, SQLite, Chromium Embedded Framework, Data Mining, Cassandra, and PostgresSQL...  

Iâ€™ve worked with Java and JEE for years, but... they didnâ€™t make this list. :grimacing:

### What I'm doing

- Working on exciting new features in Plagius - Plagiarism detection software.
- - Now there is a stable version of Plagius for Mac  \o/ðŸŽ‰.
- Learning more about distributed database systems, Vue, CEF, and cross-platform development, Avalonia...

### What can I do for you?

While I focus on my own projects, Iâ€™m always interested in hearing about something exciting. Feel free to reach out if you think thereâ€™s a great fit!
