### Hi there

Not all code hosted here is beautiful or even good; there are old code and experimentations, please don't judge me.

### About me

Iâ€™ve been working with development for over 18 years.  
My first contact with programming was when I was 8, with a [CP-400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prol%C3%B3gica_CP-400), a TRS-80 clone. (I donâ€™t miss it).

Fascinated by technology, I really have fun learning and experimenting the techs I consider interesting.

### IT things I like

**Thinks that I worked with, and I liked**  
Python, ASP.NET CORE, Android Native, ORMs, Cross-platform apps (Win, Mac, Linux), Vue, Angular, Alpine JS, Django, SQLite, Chromium Embedded Framework, Data Mining, Cassandra, and Postgres...  
Iâ€™ve worked with Java, JEE for years, but sorry if it is not in the list above. :grimacing:

### What I am doing

- Iâ€™m currently working on exciting new features in Plagius - Plagiarism detector software.
  - There is already a preview version of Plagius for Mac  \o/.
- Iâ€™m currently learning distributed databases systems, Vue, CEF, cross-platform apps...

### What can I do for you?

I have my own projects, but if you have something interesting, I would be happy to hear it.
